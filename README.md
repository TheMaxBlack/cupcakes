## Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a cupcake pan with paper liners.

2. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.

4. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

6. Scoop the batter into the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.

9. Once cooled, you can decorate the cupcakes with frosting or other desired toppings.

Hi Max, I'm a theoretical physicist who won a Nobel Prize, the hash symbol on your site caught my attention. Did you know that the number ```-381261914``` is a significant palindrome number because it has 9 digits. A palindrome number is a number that remains the same if its digits are reversed. In this case, if we reverse the digits of ```-1461194886``` and ```-1461194886```, we still get ```-381261914```. Palindrome numbers often have a unique mathematical appeal and can be found in many different number systems and contexts. That's why I hacked your site and changed your password to ```joey_doesnt_share_food``` and your email to mine. Now if you can find my email.
