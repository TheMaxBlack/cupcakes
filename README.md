# Max's Cupcakes Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a cupcake pan with paper liners.

2. In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.

4. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

6. Scoop the batter into the prepared cupcake liners, filling each about two-thirds full.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.

8. Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.

9. Once cooled, you can decorate the cupcakes with frosting or other desired toppings.
